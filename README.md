# MICS_Internship
Repository for my internship at the laboratory MICS - CentraleSupelec (Paris, France). The research is mainly focused in high frequency trading and the investigation of Hawkes processes' properties:

- For the first goal, we use tick-by-tick and aggregated trades & quote data provided by BNP Paribas in order to reconstruct and analyze the complete order flow. The reference artcle being re-done is:
   - https://hal-centralesupelec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01705074.

- For the second objective, we study how time discretization affects the estimation of the process' parameters in different scales. The main papers used for this task are: 
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04314;
  - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04592.pdf;
  - https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3597938.

- The mathematical text and a resume of results already reached can be found in the following (open) Overleaf projects:
